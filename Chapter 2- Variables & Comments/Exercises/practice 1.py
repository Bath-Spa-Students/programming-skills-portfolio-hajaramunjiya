#Write a python code that uses three variables x, y, and z with respective values 10,20 and 30. Add all the variables and then store the result in variable a. Print the value of a.
# Define the variables with their respective values
x = 10
y = 20
z = 30

# Add the variables and store the result in variable 'a'
a = x + y + z

# Print the value of 'a'
print("The value of 'a' is:", a)

#run this code, it will add the values of x, y, and z, store the result in a, and then print the value of a, which should be 60 in this case.
