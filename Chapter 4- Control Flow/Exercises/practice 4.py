#Write a python program with an if-else statement that displays Speed is normal if the speed variable is within the range of 24 to 56. If the speed variable's value is outside this range, display 'Speed is abnormal

# Assign a value to the speed variable
speed = 35

# Check if the speed is within the range of 24 to 56
# the program checks if the speed variable is within the range of 24 to 56 using the if-else statemen
if 24 <= speed <= 56:
    print("Speed is normal")
else:
    print("Speed is abnormal")
#then print message based on the result
