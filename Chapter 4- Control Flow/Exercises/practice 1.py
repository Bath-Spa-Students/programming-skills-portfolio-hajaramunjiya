#Write a python program with if statement that assigns 20 to the variable y and assigns 40 to the variable z if the variable & is greater than 100

# Assign a value to the variable x
x = 120

# Check if x is greater than 100
#This program checks if the variable x is greater than 100.
if x > 100:
    # If true, assign 20 to variable y and 40 to variable z
    y = 20
    z = 40
    print("x is greater than 100. Assigning values to y and z.")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 100.")
    #If it is, it assigns 20 to variable y and 40 to variable z. Otherwise, it prints a message indicating that x is not greater than 100.

# Print the values of y and z
print("Value of y:", y)
print("Value of z:", z)
#Finally, it prints the values of y and z.

# #Note that the y and z variables need to be defined outside of the if block if you want to access them later.
