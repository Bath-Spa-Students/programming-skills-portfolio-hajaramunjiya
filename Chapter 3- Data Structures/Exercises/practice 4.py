#Assume the lists numbers1 has 100 elements and numbers2 is an empty list. Write code that copies the values in numbers to numbers2.

# Assume 'numbers1' has 100 elements and 'numbers2' is an empty list
numbers1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...]  # Example: Replace with your 100 elements
numbers2 = []  # Initialize an empty list 'numbers2'

# Copy the values from 'numbers1' to 'numbers2'
for number in numbers1:
    numbers2.append(number)

# Now 'numbers2' contains the same values as 'numbers1'
